## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The deployment of a Dockerized Django application was automated through a multibranch pipeline Jenkins Job and then deployed on a cloud provider. The Django application was forked from **@mahmoud254/Booster_CI_CD_Project** repository, then a **Dockerfile** was made and committed into this repository. 

Multiple brances were created in order to simulate the workflow used by the Django team as shown below:
* **Production Branch**: It represents the latest _running_ version of the application.
* **Master Branch**: A clone of the production branch for convenience. 
* **Develop Branch**: The branch that represents the most up-dated version currently under development.
* **Fature Branches**: Temporary branches representing a feature of the application.

Then a Jenkins multibranch pipeline was created, representing the three major branches, Production, Master, Develop, with each branch's configuration stored in a **Jenkinsfile**. To ensure maximum uptime for both three branches, three nodes were created as executers for the Jenkins server.


## üöÄ Live Demo <a name = "demo"></a>

You can try out the Jenkins server and the three deployed versions using these links. However, due to the unnecessary cost of running a VMWate these links will be valid until **29th of November 2021**.
* **Jenkins Server**: guest:guest @ http://167.172.177.126:8080
* **Production Branch Node**: http://167.172.177.126
* **Master Branch Node**: http://167.172.177.126:2020
* **Develop Branch Node**: http://167.172.177.126:9069

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
