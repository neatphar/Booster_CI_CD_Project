## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The deployment of a Dockerized Django application was automated through a multibranch pipeline Jenkins Job and then deployed on a cloud provider. The Django application was forked from **@mahmoud254/Booster_CI_CD_Project** repository, then a **Dockerfile** was made and committed into this repository. 

Multiple brances were created in order to simulate the workflow used by the Django team as shown below:
* **Production Branch**: It represents the latest _running_ version of the application.
* **Master Branch**: A clone of the production branch for convenience. 
* **Develop Branch**: The branch that represents the most up-dated version currently under development.
* **Fature Branches**: Temporary branches representing a feature of the application.

Then, a Jenkins multibranch pipeline was created, representing the three major branches, Production, Master, Develop, with each branch's configuration stored in a **Jenkinsfile**. To ensure maximum uptime for both three branches, three nodes were created as executers for the Jenkins server.


## üöÄ Live Demo <a name = "demo"></a>

You can try out the Jenkins server and the three deployed versions using these links. However, due to the unnecessary cost of running a VM these links will be valid until **29th of November, 2021.**
* **Jenkins Server**: http://167.172.177.126:8080
* **Production Branch Node**: http://167.172.177.126
* **Master Branch Node**: http://167.172.177.126:2020
* **Develop Branch Node**: http://167.172.177.126:9069

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

This section will discuss how to deploy a copy of this project and run it on a virtual machine along with the Jenkins server and nodes for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

This project needs the following dependencies in order to function correctly:

```
* A virtual machine with 2GB RAM and at least 5 GB of free space.
* Docker.
* Knowlegde of Jenkins CI/CD
* Comfortable working with Python, especially Django Framework and Gunicorn.
```

### Installing

A step by step guide to show you how to create the server and deploy the branches using **Dockerfile** and **Jenkinsfile** on Ubuntu.

Build and run a Jenkins server Docker container using the Jenkins-with-Docker [Dockerfile](https://github.com/neatphar/Booster_CI_CD_Project/blob/additional/Jenkins%20with%20Docker/Dockerfile) to give Jenkins access to the Docker host CLI.

```
docker build -t jenkins-dockerized .
chmod ugo+rx /var/run/docker.sock
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --name Jenkins jenkins-dockerized
```

Then, build and run a Jenkins node Container using Jenkins-node-with-Docker [Dockerfile](https://github.com/neatphar/Booster_CI_CD_Project/blob/additional/Jenkins%20Nodes/Dockerfile) as well.

```
docker build -t jenkins-node .
chmod ugo+rx /var/run/docker.sock
docker run -d -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --name Jenkins-Node-1 jenkins-node
```
Repeat the last step to make other two different nodes with different name tags.
```
docker run -d -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --name Jenkins-Node-2 jenkins-node
docker run -d -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --name Jenkins-Node-3 jenkins-node
```

Then, build and run a Jenkins node Container using Jenkins-node-with-Docker [Dockerfile](https://github.com/neatphar/Booster_CI_CD_Project/blob/additional/Jenkins%20Nodes/Dockerfile) as well.

```

```


Then, build and run a Jenkins node Container using Jenkins-node-with-Docker [Dockerfile](https://github.com/neatphar/Booster_CI_CD_Project/blob/additional/Jenkins%20Nodes/Dockerfile) as well.

```

```


End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
